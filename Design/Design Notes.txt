Phase 1:
DONE - I want to be able to keep track of time spent throughout the day
DONE - I will use individual tasks, with totals for day and all-time
DONE - I will give each task a name
DONE - I will manually start and stop a task, like a chess timer
DONE - The app will keep track of blocks of time a task was worked on
DONE - The app will reset "Today Time" counters at the start of the day

Phase 2:
- I want to be able to group tasks into categories (Infra, Dev)
  - Use groups in a DataGrid
- I want to be able to modify time spent on a task
  - How do you modify it?  Do you change a timeblock or just apply a modification to the task?
	- Add an extra "modification" block
- I want the app to track idle time
- I want to be notified when the timer has been idle for N minutes
- I want a summary of the previous day's tasks (totals only)

Phase 3:
- I want a view, like a timeline, that shows when I worked on each task
- I want to import tasks from TFS
- I want the app to monitor active windows and optional display another timeline with this info

- Main Window
  - Shows: 
    - List of tasks, grouped by category
    - Start of Day (9:05a)
    - Idle Time (1.35h)
    - Total Time (by category)
      - Dev: 3.25h
      - Infra: 2.6h
    - Window Title has active task name in it
  - Menu Bar:
    - File      
      - Settings...
      - Exit
    - Tasks
      - New Task... (Ctrl+N)
      - Start
      - Stop
      - Edit...
      - Delete
      - Import from TFS...
      - Previous Day Summary...
